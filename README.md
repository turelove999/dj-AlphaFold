# AlphaFold 3

This package provides an implementation of the inference pipeline of AlphaFold
3. See below for how to access the model parameters. You may only use AlphaFold
3 model parameters if received directly from Google. Use is subject to these
[terms of use](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md).

Any publication that discloses findings arising from using this source code, the
model parameters or outputs produced by those should [cite](#citing-this-work)
the
[Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07487-w)
paper.

Please also refer to the Supplementary Information for a detailed description of
the method.

AlphaFold 3 is also available at
[alphafoldserver.com](https://alphafoldserver.com) for non-commercial use,
though with a more limited set of ligands and covalent modifications.

If you have any questions, please contact the AlphaFold team at
[alphafold@google.com](mailto:alphafold@google.com).

## Obtaining Model Parameters

This repository contains all necessary code for AlphaFold 3 inference. To
request access to the AlphaFold 3 model parameters, please complete
[this form](https://forms.gle/svvpY4u2jsHEwWYS6). Access will be granted at
Google DeepMind’s sole discretion. We will aim to respond to requests within 2–3
business days. You may only use AlphaFold 3 model parameters if received
directly from Google. Use is subject to these
[terms of use](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md).

## Installation and Running Your First Prediction

See the [installation documentation](docs/installation.md).

Once you have installed AlphaFold 3, you can test your setup using e.g. the
following input JSON file named `fold_input.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "2PV7",
  "sequences": [
    {
      "protein": {
        "id": ["A", "B"],
        "sequence": "GMRESYANENQFGFKTINSDIHKIVIVGGYGKLGGLFARYLRASGYPISILDREDWAVAESILANADVVIVSVPINLTLETIERLKPYLTENMLLADLTSVKREPLAKMLEVHTGAVLGLHPMFGADIASMAKQVVVRCDGRFPERYEWLLEQIQIWGAKIYQTNATEHDHNMTYIQALRHFSTFANGLHLSKQPINLANLLALSSPIYRLELAMIGRLFAQDAELYADIIMDKSENLAVIETLKQTYDEALTFFENNDRQGFIDAFHKVRDWFGDYSEQFLKESRQLLQQANDLKQG"
      }
    }
  ],
  "modelSeeds": [1],
  "dialect": "alphafold3",
  "version": 1
}
```

You can then run AlphaFold 3 using the following command:

```
docker run -it \
    --volume $HOME/af_input:/root/af_input \
    --volume $HOME/af_output:/root/af_output \
    --volume <MODEL_PARAMETERS_DIR>:/root/models \
    --volume <DATABASES_DIR>:/root/public_databases \
    --gpus all \
    alphafold3 \
    python run_alphafold.py \
    --json_path=/root/af_input/fold_input.json \
    --model_dir=/root/models \
    --output_dir=/root/af_output
```

There are various flags that you can pass to the `run_alphafold.py` command, to
list them all run `python run_alphafold.py --help`. Two fundamental flags that
control which parts AlphaFold 3 will run are:

*   `--run_data_pipeline` (defaults to `true`): whether to run the data
    pipeline, i.e. genetic and template search. This part is CPU-only, time
    consuming and could be run on a machine without a GPU.
*   `--run_inference` (defaults to `true`): whether to run the inference. This
    part requires a GPU.
